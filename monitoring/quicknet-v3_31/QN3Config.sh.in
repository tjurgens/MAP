# This file freezes some of the configuration results of QuickNet3
# so that they can be reused by subsequent QuickNet3 clients. 
# Specifically, we want to remember whether we need extra system
# libs on this platform.  We might as well define the path 
# to the installed header files too.  This sits alongside
# the libquicknet.a library file.  It is used as is in the build directory,
# but edited to use the correct directories when installed.
