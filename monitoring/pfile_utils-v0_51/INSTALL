This is the INSTALL file for the pfile_utils package.

Prerequisites
=============

Pfile_utils needs the QuickNet3 MLP library.



Pfile_utils is configured under GNU Autoconf for ease of installation.  
It does, however, depend on several other pieces.  Hence, ./configure 
accepts the following specific options:


    --with-quicknet=DIR	Where to find the QuickNet library.
			This should point to the "lib" directory.  The
			configure script will look in lib/pkgconfig for
			the quicknet3.pc package config file.

Once you've located these, it should just be ./configure ...
then make, then make install.
