=========================
=== pfile_utils v0_50 ===
=========================

Version "v0_50" of pfile_utils is the first version with a version number
and a NEWS file.  

The differences between the long-time installed ICSI version (approx
Oct 2001 -> Dec 2005 inclusive) are relatively minor and not completely known.
Some changes include:

 - pfile_klt and pfile_lda now accept multiple, comma-separated,
   pfiles for feature input (not supported on 2001->2005 installed version
   but maybe had been available in project-specific versions).  
 - pfile_lda now optionally supports a separate label file
   (not supported on 2001->2005 installed version but maybe had been available
   in project-specific versions)
 - Added man page entry for pfile_lda and pfile_addsil.
 - Fixed to work with QuickNet v3_11 API.
 - in theory works for >32 bit pfiles (due to changes in QuickNet), although
   not fully tested yet.
 - Added COPYING file.
 - Added NEWS file.
 - Updated INSTALL file.
 - Removed intvec dependency.
 - Now use pkg-config to find QuickNet3.
 - Fixed install stuff, including adding name tranform.
 - Removed RCS stuff from Makefile.in.
 - pfile_utils.1 now pfile_utils.man in src dir.
 - Fixed some mess associated with icsiarray.

Note that there may exist versions of pfile_utils where pfile_lda and
pfile_klt support the "//" syntax for parallel pfiles.  v0_50 of pfile_utils
and mainstream versions of QuickNet do _not_ support this.
