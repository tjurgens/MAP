Warning: Could not find an exact (case-sensitive) match for 'GETGAMMAPARAM'.
/net/medisan/home/tim/matlab/PEMO/GetGammaParam.mexa64 is a case-insensitive
match and will be used instead.
You can improve the performance of your code by using exact
name matches and we therefore recommend that you update your
usage accordingly. Alternatively, you can disable this warning using
warning('off','MATLAB:dispatcher:InexactCaseMatch').
This warning will become an error in future releases.
